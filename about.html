      Our Story
    </h2>

    <p class="body">
      Formed in 2025 by the Job's daughters of Clermont, Florida, Jobees Robotics is a FRC team learning and growing as we progress. We are located at the Clermont Masonic Lodge at 865 West Desoto Street, Clermont, FL 32179, and our meetings are at 2pm on the 2nd and 4th Sundays of the month.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Job's Daughters International is an organization for young women that was founded over 100 years ago. Its focus has always been to give young women skills to be confident adults and leaders. It teaches the values of leadership, public speaking, service, respect for parents and elders, and teamwork. And throughout they form amazing friendships and connections.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Although the order was founded based on the teachings of the Book of Job in the Bible, such as patience and strength in adversity, membership only requires a belief in a higher power and not a specific religious affiliation or Christian belief. There are prayers in our meetings and the Bible is placed on our altar, however other holy books are welcome on the altar as well.
