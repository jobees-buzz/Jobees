      <p class="body">
  FIRST (For Inspiration and Recognition of Science and Technology) is an international organization that aims to inspire young people to be leaders in science and technology through engaging, mentor-based programs. Founded in 1989 by inventor Dean Kamen, FIRST offers a range of programs for students of all ages, from elementary school to high school and beyond. The organization emphasizes teamwork, innovation, and real-world problem-solving skills, encouraging participants to work collaboratively to design, build, and program robots to compete in various challenges. FIRST also promotes core values such as Gracious Professionalism® and Coopertition®, fostering a positive and inclusive environment where students can develop their technical skills while building confidence and leadership abilities.

      <p class="body">
 The FIRST Robotics Competition (FRC) is a high school robotics program that challenges teams of students to design, build, and program robots to compete in a themed game each year. Established in 1992 as part of the broader FIRST organization, FRC combines the excitement of sports with the rigors of science and technology. Each season begins with a kickoff event where the game rules are revealed, and teams have six weeks to construct their robots using a standard kit of parts. FRC robots can weigh up to 120 pounds on a 27' x 54' field, and are a highly competitive, rigorous program.  </p>

      <p class="body">
 The FIRST Tech Challenge (FTC) is an alternative to the FRC, serving as a “JV” version to introduce younger students to the competition, allowing grades 7-12 to participate. After the FRC was launched, the FTC was launched later as a more accessible, mid-sized, and lower-cost alternative, evolving from the FIRST Vex Challenge (FVC) in 2007. Students must build, design, and program the robot, similarly to the FRC. However, FTC robots must fit within an 18-inch cube on a 12' x 12' field. </p>
